                        <li>Designed and implemented a monitoring system bypass configuration, addressing the issue of high load and latency caused by the traditional backend
                            method of fetching data for individual projects. When creating a project, the system determines whether to enable bypass, allowing projects with bypass
                            enabled to periodically batch fetch user performance data and logs from external monitoring systems after going live. The data is written into memory and
                            synchronized to the data warehouse, significantly improving data processing efficiency and reducing the load on the main system.</li>
                        <li>The system can also
                            automatically initialize bypass configuration upon startup</li>

                            functions, variables, and multi-level dependencies to optimize code checks; engineering verification of SQL and table creation statements, using EXPLAIN
                            SQL to check database node configurations; displaying and allowing internal management to track the review status of process inspection reports in the
                            backend management system, supporting fuzzy search, and optimizing data loading speed through pagination and multithreading.
